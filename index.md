# Week 1 Lab on January 11th 
Today's lab consists of three major components:
* Installing Visual Studio Code in several clicks.
* Following "simple" step to remotely connect to your ieng account that CSE department gives you!
* Trying Some Commands to get familiar with the tools we are going to use throughout the quarter.
# Installing Visual Studio Code
Under this section, we are going to give a step by step instruction for you to successfully install Visual Studio Code (we will refer this as VSCode in later parts of this lab report). 
## Step 1: Go to the right place to download the right VSCode
Go to the official VSCode website to install the application: [VSCode Website](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 

After clicking the hyperlink, you should be able to see the webpage similar to the screenshot below:

If yes, you are good so far. If you are not seeing this page and see something like 404,sorry. Check your internet connection and click the link again. If it is still not working, contact UC San Diego IT Support at (858) 246-4357.

## Step 2: Download the VSCode package
By far, you have gotten to the right place to download the VSCode. You are just a couple of click away from finishing the installation process. 
Let's click on the blue button, as shown in my screenshot above. Don't worry. The VSCode website is intelligent enough to recognize your computer operation system, so there is no need for you to switch a different package to install. Just click the blue button; the VSCode package will get installed to your automatically. If you are connected to the internet, the installation should complete within a few minutes. 

## Step 3: Install VSCode to your computer
Now you have successfully downloaded the installation package to your computer. Click on the package and follow the instruction to get VSCode downloaded to your computer! Once the installation process is complete, open the application; you should see a similar app interface like the screenshot below:

## Conclusion
Cool. You have finished the very first step of this lab by successfully installing the VSCode to your own computer. **Congratulations!** Please follow along with the second component of the lab to set up your CSE 15L account for future course uses.
