# Lab Report 3
Welcome to my lab report 3 webpage. In this lab report, we will explore four 
command-line options for the command `grep`. Each option is followed by two
examples to demonstrate its use and output. Without further due, let's start
the lab report!

# Option 1: `-n`


```ruby
❯ grep -n "Hello" *.txt
CH4.txt:69:Children’s earliest efforts at make-believe also reveal how challenging they ﬁnd the task of detaching thought from reality. Initially, object substitutions are closely tied to the real things they represent. Toddlers between ages 1 1/2 and 2 generally use only realistic-looking objects while pretending—a toy telephone to talk into or a cup to drink from.9 Once, I handed a 21-month-old a small wooden block, put another to my ear, and called her on the phone: “Ring! Ring! Hello, Lynnay!” She responded by throwing down the block and turning to another activity. Yet when given a plastic replica of a push-button phone, Lynnay readily put the receiver to her ear and pretended to converse.
CH4.txt:151:As children engage in play talk, they not only build their vocabularies but correct one another’s errors, either directly or by demonstrating the acceptable way to speak. In one instance, a kindergartner enacting a telephone conversation said, “Hello, come to my house, please.” Her play partner quickly countered with appropriate telephone greeting behavior: “No, ﬁrst you’ve got to say ‘How are you? What are you doing?’”28
